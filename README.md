### Stocks and Financial Analysis Dashboard

**Project Overview:**
The "Stocks-and-Financial-Analysis-Dashboard" project centers around gaining theoretical knowledge of stocks and financial analysis, focusing on essential metrics such as PE (Price to Earning Ratio), Debt to Equity Ratio, ROE (Return on Equity), CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate), Cash Flow, P/B Ratio, and Current Ratio. The objective is to understand these metrics and apply them to analyze historical data of companies for making informed investment decisions.


- **PE (Price to Earning Ratio):**
  This ratio indicates the relationship between a company's stock price and its earnings per share. A higher PE ratio can suggest that investors expect higher future growth.

- **Debt to Equity Ratio:**
  This ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing its total debt to shareholders' equity. A lower ratio may indicate a company's ability to manage its debt.

- **ROE (Return on Equity):**
  ROE assesses a company's profitability in relation to shareholders' equity. It indicates how effectively a company generates profits using the investments of its shareholders.

- **CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate):**
  CAGR quantifies the annual growth rate over a specific period, taking into account the compounding effect. It's often used to assess investment growth.

- **Cash Flow:**
  Cash flow reflects the amount of money flowing in and out of a business. Positive cash flow indicates a company's ability to manage its operations effectively.

- **P/B Ratio (Price to Book Ratio):**
  This ratio compares a company's stock price with its book value, offering insights into how investors value the company's assets.

- **Current Ratio:**
  The current ratio evaluates a company's ability to meet short-term obligations with its short-term assets. A higher current ratio may indicate better liquidity.
